Programs are platform independent.
1.	Write a program that can solve the quadratic equation
2.	Write a program that can perform linear search (Specific element).
3.	Write a program that can perform linear search to find the location of any specific element. (Maybe two elements)
4.	Write a program that can count the characters in a string.
5.	Write a program that can sort the element of an array in any order using bubble sort.
6.	Write a program that sort the elements of an array in any order using insertion sort algorithm.
7.	Write a program that sort elements of an array in any order using selection sort algorithm.
8.	Write a program to find an element in an unsorted array (at the beginning, middle, end or given position)
9.	Write a program that can search any specific element in an array using binary search.
